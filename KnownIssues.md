1.In a real D&D session, the DM continuously talks and guides the players through the game. But in AIDND, because the interaction is turn-based and requires the player to actively trigger each step, the experience feels unnatural.

2.Right now, the damage and status effects generated by the combat agent are not actually being written back to the JSON state. We need a way to properly update the JSON after each action.

3.Even if we instruct the narrator to avoid skipping ahead based on minimal turn count, it still sometimes jumps directly into the encounter phase. The transitions between narration and combat feel inconsistent.

4.The combat agent occasionally ignores the provided function calls entirely and starts hallucinating actions. The enemy attacks or player attacks it describes often do not exist in the JSON state at all.

If the goal is simply to ensure technical functionality without regarding the gameplay experience, then the game does indeed run. For instance, during initial testing with a single AI DM narrator, the Storygraph constraints successfully prevented the user from derailing the AI into casual conversation.
