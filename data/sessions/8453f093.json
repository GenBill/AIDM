The captain stands at the helm barking orders to keep the ship steady as the winds pick up.\n\nAs you ponder the day's journey, you suddenly hear a massive splash nearby. Turning to look, you see a monstrous figure emerging from the sea, its scaled body glistening with water as it hauls itself onto the deck before you.\n\n[Entered: Merrow Encounter]\nAs lightning flashes across the sky, a monster hauls itself up onto the deck!
