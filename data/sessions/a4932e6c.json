The sea’s gentle sway contrasts sharply with the ominous storm clouds gathering above, each wave whispering a dire warning of things to come. The crew moves about with a sense of urgency, their eyes flitting nervously to the horizon.\n\nYou recall the tales of Stormwreck Isle—a place whispered about in the taverns of Neverwinter as ominous and foreboding. It's said that many ships have been lost to its treacherous waters. The very name of the island seems to hang in the air, heavy with mystery.\n\nJust as you ponder over your voyage's destination, a flash of lightning streaks across the sky, illuminating the vast, rolling sea with blinding brilliance. The storm is nearly upon you, and the ship buckles under the sudden gusts of wind. You feel the air thrumming with electric energy, full of the unknown dangers that lay ahead."

The steady rhythm of the ocean is now a chaotic dance under the gathering storm.\n\nYour gaze drifts toward the edge of the deck, where something unsettling catches your eye. A massive, scaled armament claws onto the ship's railing, pulling up with a strength that no ordinary creature possesses. As another flash of lightning streaks across the sky, it reveals a monstrosity—a sea monster, with scales glistening like dark bronze in the rain.\n\nYou instinctively ready yourself for what might come next, knowing that danger is imminent."

The Scaled Queen demands 300 gold pieces in tribute, or your ship becomes wreckage beneath the sea!\"\n\nSeeing your uncertainty, it tilts its head, regarding you with a mixture of malice and curiosity. You notice the crew around you—they seem apprehensive but ready to assist if needed. You can attempt to negotiate with the merrow, try a more creative solution to outwit it, or prepare for a direct confrontation. Whatever you choose, swift action is necessary, as the storm's fury continues to climb."

The tribute remains 300 gold pieces, or you will face the wrath of the sea!\" it growls, its patience clearly wearing thin."
