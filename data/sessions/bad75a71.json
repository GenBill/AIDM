Hues of red and gold pierce through the ominous clouds, casting an eerie glow over the deck of your sturdy vessel. Neverwinter's port is now but a memory, replaced by the swift winds and salty tang of open seas. The ship rocks gently with the swell of the waves, each rise and fall a reminder of your passage toward Stormwreck Isle. The distant rumble of thunder serves as a forewarning of the tempest looming on the horizon.\n\nAround you, seasoned sailors adjust the sails and check the rigging, preparing for the onslaught of the approaching storm. Their movements are quick and deliberate, betraying a sense of urgency. The air is thick with anticipation and the scent of sea brine.\n\nAs you gather your thoughts, the reality of your location along the voyage dawns on you: you are on a ship bound for a place rich with mystery, danger, and adventure. And the journey is just beginning.\n\nSuddenly, a low growl reverberates from the depths of the seas below, and you catch sight of a massive creature hauling itself onto the deck, scales glistening in the dim light. Its eyes lock onto yours, filled with a primal hunger.\n\n[Entered: Merrow Encounter]\nAs lightning flashes across the sky, a monster hauls itself up onto the deck! 'These waters belong to the Scaled Queen. I’m here to collect her tribute.'"
