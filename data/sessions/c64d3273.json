The ship rocks gently under your feet as it navigates the rolling waves, but the atmosphere is tense. Above you, the sky is a tumult of swirling dark clouds, edged with the ominous red glow of dawn—a sailor's warning of a storm to come.\n\nAround you, the crew moves with brisk efficiency, securing the rigging and casting worried glances at the sky. The salty sea air bites at your skin, carrying with it the sounds of distant thunder—a harbinger of the tempest that threatens to unleash its fury upon you.\n\nAs you contemplate your surroundings, the distant cry of a seabird pierces the air, and the horizon looms closer with every passing wave, bringing you one step nearer to the unfathomable mysteries of Stormwreck Isle."

Above, the sails catch the tense wind, muscles taut and ready to spring into action. The air is filled with the sharp crack of sails and the rhythmic groan of the ship's wood adapting to the shifting sea.\n\nHowever, something else catches your eye—a strange ripple near the ship's edge, different from the usual play of light on water. Suddenly, there's a tremendous splash as a monstrous form emerges from the sea. With webbed hands and a grotesque visage, a merrow hauls itself over the side of the ship! The beast, with muscles rippling beneath its slick, scaly skin, lets out a chilling roar, revealing rows of sharp teeth.\n\nThe crew stumbles back, eyes wide with fear, as the creature growls threateningly, challenging anyone brave enough to stand in its path.\n\n[Entered: Merrow Encounter]\nAs lightning flashes across the sky, a monster hauls itself up onto the deck! 'These waters belong to the Scaled Queen. I’m here to collect her tribute.'"
