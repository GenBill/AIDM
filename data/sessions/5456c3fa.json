You can feel the salt-laden breeze tug at your clothes and the tension that hangs as thick as the clouds above. The sea stretches endlessly around, a vast expanse leading you to your destination."

Nearby, sailors work diligently, tying off ropes and adjusting sails, their faces serious and focused.\n\nJust then, a crack of lightning illuminates the surf beyond the rails, revealing something ominously slicing through the waves towards your ship—a large shadow that seems to glide effortlessly through the churning sea.\n\nSuddenly, without warning, a monstrous form bursts from the ocean and crashes onto the deck! Water sprays in all directions as a creature, half-man, half-fish, with a terrifying visage, rises to its full height. It's a merrow and its intent is anything but friendly."

The storm crackles above, mimicking the charged atmosphere on board.\n\nWhat would you like to do?
