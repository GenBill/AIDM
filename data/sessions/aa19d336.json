You traveled to the city of Neverwinter with your company to serve in both the army and the watch. Over time, you developed distrust with many of your fellow soldiers. They seemed to enjoy their authority and exploited the people they were supposed to protect. Personal Goal: Banish a Shadow of Death. Researching images from your dreams pointed you to Sword Coast, not far from Neverwinter. A remote cloister holds a temple to the dragon god Bahamut, who is a patron of heroes and a champion of justice. Someone at the cloister may hold the key to the impending doom your deity wishes you to avert.",
