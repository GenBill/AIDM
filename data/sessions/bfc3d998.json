You are standing on the deck, where sailors move about, ensuring everything is secured for what lies ahead. The air is thick with anticipation and the faint scent of salt and coming rain.\n\nStanding at the railing, gazing into the horizon where the sea meets the sky, you're very aware of being a small figure upon a vast, untamable ocean."

As you make your way along the side, cords whipping slightly in the breeze and sails flapping half-heartedly, there's a sudden, ominous splash followed by a loud, guttural growl. \n\nAt the ship's edge, something pulls itself up—a creature with scales shimmering in the dimming light, webbed hands clinging tightly to the railing as eyes like pools of stormy ink lock onto you. A merrow, part of a species known to inhabit treacherous waters like these, has taken a peculiar interest in your vessel.\n\n[Entered: Merrow Encounter]\nAs lightning flashes across the sky, a monster hauls itself up onto the deck!

She demands her due—400 gold pieces—or you shall not pass unmolested.\" The merrow's tone is clear. However, there seems to be room for negotiation if you wish to attempt it."

Utilizing a commanding yet diplomatic tone, Unn negotiates with the merrow. “Four hundred gold is a steep demand, and yet, she might be content with less, considering this humble vessel,” you say, gesturing around at the modest ship.\n\nThe merrow pauses, its interest piqued by your words and the persuasive sway in your argument. It considers your proposal, responding with a slight nod. “Very well, brave soul. Three hundred it shall be. You have shown the respect due a queen's subject,” it says, in a slightly more amicable tone.\n\nWith a successful negotiation, you have managed to reduce the tribute demand significantly, and it seems the merrow is appeased, allowing the journey to continue.\n\n[Entered: Arrival at Dragon's Rest]\nStormwreck Isle—now visible off the bow—promises rare wonders.
