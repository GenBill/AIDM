Behind you, a few anxious sailors clutch ropes and belaying pins, eyeing the creature that has just hauled itself over the rail.\n\nI’m your Dungeon Master for this voyage—I describe the world, its dangers, and its people, and you describe what your character does in response. Whenever the outcome of an action is uncertain, we’ll usually roll a d20 and add modifiers from your character sheet to see how well you do.\n\nRight now, you’re a few days out from the city of Neverwinter, on the way to a place called Stormwreck Isle—an island with a grim reputation. A blood‑red sunrise and dark storm clouds surround the ship, and lightning flickers on the horizon.\n\nClinging to the rail is the intruder: a hulking, fish‑fanged humanoid, dripping seawater, with mottled scales and cruel, yellow eyes. It glares across the deck at you and the crew and growls in a low, guttural voice, \n\n“**These waters belong to the Scaled Queen. I’m here to collect her tribute.**”\n\nThe sailors look to you, clearly hoping you’ll take the lead.\n\nYou can respond however you like. Some possibilities:\n- **Negotiate**: try to talk it down, bargain, or stall.\n- **Attack the merrow**: draw steel or cast a spell and strike first.\n- **Try a creative tactic**: use the ship, the crew, or a trick to outsmart or drive it off.\n- **Ask about the Scaled Queen**: try to get more information before you decide.\n\nWhat does lll do or say next?"

Rain patters on the deck around you, thunder grumbling overhead. A few sailors inch back, giving you space but clearly listening.\n\n“How much do I want?” It jabs a clawed thumb at its chest. “Four hundred gold. Tribute for the Scaled Queen. Pay, and this ship and its soft meat keep breathing.”\n\nIt leans closer, fish‑reeking breath washing over you. “But… if you’ve got a silver tongue, maybe we talk. What do you offer instead, little land‑walker?”\n\nThe crew whisper anxiously. Four hundred gold is far more than this voyage is worth to them.\n\nYou’ve opened negotiations, and the creature is listening—for now.\n\nYou can:\n- Try to **talk him down on the price** (persuade, bluff, or intimidate him into taking less).\n- Offer **something else** as tribute (cargo, a future favor, information, etc.).\n- **Threaten** him, making it clear you won’t be easy prey.\n- Change tack and **attack** or try some **creative trick** using the ship or crew.\n\nWhat exactly does lll say or propose next in this negotiation?\n\n[Entered: Negotiating with the Merrow]\nThe merrow looms over you on the slick deck, water streaming from its scaled form.

A few sailors hold their breath.\n\nThen it snorts, a wet, derisive sound, and bares its fangs in a humorless grin.\n\n\"You think the Scaled Queen cares what you land‑rats think of her?\" it growls. \"But… you argue boldly for such soft prey. Three hundred…\" It rolls the number around in its throat like a stone. \"Three hundred it is. Pay it now, and I let this tub float on. Push your luck further, and I’ll decorate the waves with your guts.\"\n\nThe crew murmur nervously—three hundred gold is still a huge sum, but better than losing everything.\n\nRight now, the merrow’s demand is 300 gp in coin or goods. It’s still listening, but its patience is thinner.\n\nYou can:\n- **Agree to pay the 300 gp** in coin or cargo.\n- Try to **haggle further**, aiming to bring it down again.\n- **Threaten or intimidate** it into taking even less—or nothing at all.\n- **Refuse outright**, risking that the merrow attacks.\n\nWhat does lll do?"

The merrow’s gills flare wide; its eyes bulge with sudden, furious shock.\n\nThen it throws its head back and lets out a roar that rattles the rigging.\n\n\"Coward?\" it bellows, slamming a clawed fist into the rail hard enough to splinter wood. \"You dare insult a champion of the Scaled Queen on her own waters? I’ll drag you down and crack your bones between my teeth!\"\n\nAny hint of negotiation is gone. It hauls itself fully over the rail, muscles bunching, webbed claws flexing as it reaches for its wicked spear.
