      "content": "The Merrow is a large, chaotic evil monstrosity known for its aquatic nature. It has a natural armor class of 13 and 45 hit points, with a hit dice of 6d10+12. Merrows are strong creatures with a strength score of 18, and they can move at a speed of 10 feet on land and 40 feet in water.\n\nMerrows have darkvision up to 60 feet and speak Abyssal and Aquan. They are capable of breathing both air and water, thanks to their Amphibious ability.\n\nIn combat, a Merrow can perform a Multiattack, which includes one bite and one attack with either its claws or harpoon. The bite attack has a +6 to hit and deals 8 piercing damage, while the claws attack also has a +6 to hit and deals 9 slashing damage. The harpoon can be used as both a melee and ranged weapon, dealing 11 piercing damage and potentially pulling the target towards the Merrow if they fail a Strength contest.\n\nMerrows are typically found in underwater, swamp, coastal, desert, and water environments. They are a challenge rating 2 creature, making them a formidable opponent for lower-level adventurers."

To the horizon, there's nothing but open sea, though the dark clouds above hint that not all is calm on your voyage.\n\nYou remember setting sail from Neverwinter, tasked with reaching the mysterious Stormwreck Isle. Your mission is unclear, but the growing storm ahead seems anything but a coincidence. The crew around you scurries to prepare the ship for the tempest.\n\nAs the vessel rises and falls with the crest of the waves, the sky occasionally lights up with flashes from distant lightning, casting long shadows across the deck."

They're clearly worried about the storm on the horizon. As you make your way across the deck, a sudden flash of lightning illuminates the sky, painting everything in stark contrasts.\n\nIn that brief moment of bright light, you see a creature clambering over the side rail. It's a monstrous figure, dripping wet with long, tangled seaweed hanging from its body. It lets out a guttural roar as it lands on the deck with a thud. The crew members cry out in surprise and fear as a battle seems inevitable."

However, its attack is hasty and misses you, barely grazing the fabric of your garments and certainly not your skin.\n\nYour crew rally behind your successful attack, emboldened by your display of strength against the sea creature."
