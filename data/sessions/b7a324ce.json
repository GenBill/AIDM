The clouds above you are ominous, their dark mass illuminated intermittently by flashes of distant lightning. You murmur a greeting to yourself, almost as if hoping the seas will offer you a response in kind, or perhaps just to cut the tension of the looming storm.\n\nThe crew, busy with securing the sails and shouting orders, seem oblivious to your presence. Yet, the uneasy silence of nature's prelude to chaos seems to hold its breath, waiting for the tempest to break free.\n\nStay vigilant; something tells you the adventure has only just begun..."

Beyond the clamor, you notice something peculiar—a ripple in the water that moves against the tide, too directed to be the whim of the storm. Then a shadow, darker than the storm, breaching the water's surface momentarily before disappearing again.\n\nSuddenly, lightning bursts across the heavens, highlighting the silhouette of a monstrous creature hauling itself onboard. Its scales gleam wet in the unnatural light, and it gazes around with hungry eyes.\n\nThe tension hits a peak as the adventure growls to life, demanding your response!"

After a tense moment that stretches against the sound of crashing waves, it nods reluctantly. \"Fifty will suffice,\" it growls. \"But know this, travelers—next time, tribute must be paid in full.\" With a grunt, it leaps back into the dark waters, vanishing as swiftly as it appeared, allowing your journey to continue uninterrupted."

Your thoughts wander momentarily to the many secrets that may dwell here. Taking in a deep breath of the salty air, you remember why you ventured here—whether for glory, treasure, or perhaps a deeper calling. The time has come to discuss your reasons for visiting with your companions, and to determine who will take the lead as you explore. Perhaps a short rest on the beach wouldn't be unwise, gathering strength for whatever lies ahead.\n\n\"A break,\" you announce, \"might be well deserved after the tense exchange with the merrow. Let us gather our bearings before pressing on.\"\n\nTake this time to converse with your fellow adventurers and possibly introduce yourselves in more detail."
