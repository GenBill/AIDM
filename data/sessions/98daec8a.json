The storm wind whips at your clothes; the once‑calm sea now heaves with dark, churning waves. You can feel, in your gut, that you’re trained for danger like this—steel in your hand, spells or skills at the ready—but nothing forces you to start a fight.\n\nHere’s how this works for you as a player:\n- You **tell me what xx does**: talk, threaten, attack, hide, try a trick, anything that makes sense.\n- If the outcome is uncertain, I’ll call for a **roll**—usually a d20 plus a bonus from your sheet (like +3 to hit, or +4 to Persuasion, etc.).\n- I describe what happens based on that roll: success, failure, or something in between.\n\nRight now, you have a lot of options. For example, you could:\n- **Talk to the merrow**: ask what tribute it wants, stall for time, try to intimidate or persuade it.\n- **Prepare to fight**: draw your weapon, position yourself, maybe try to get the first strike in.\n- **Try a trick**: pretend you’re just a passenger with nothing of value, offer fake tribute, or lure it somewhere dangerous on the ship.\n- **Protect the crew**: shout orders, move between it and the sailors, or get non‑fighters to safety.\n\nWhat does xx do or say in response to the merrow’s demand?"

For a few long heartbeats, only the hiss of rain and the creak of the rigging answer you.\n\nThen it gives a low, rumbling chuckle.\n\n“Hmm.
