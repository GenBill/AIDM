Beyond the edge of the ship’s railing, dark clouds swirl menacingly, promising an approaching storm — a fitting name for a destination like Stormwreck Isle. The crew, experienced but tense, makes quick work securing the sails and battening down the hatches, preparing for the tumult ahead. You sense unease among them; even the seas seem anxious, their surface choppy and restless.\n\nAbove, the clouds are thick and low, rumbling occasionally with distant thunder as if in warning. This foreboding atmosphere warns of the perils that lie ahead, both natural and perhaps supernatural."

In the glow of the flash, you catch sight of something sinister and wet clawing its way onto the deck—a monstrous, aquatic creature with a wicked grin and scales shimmering like oil in the storm light.\n\nIt roars savagely, the merrow has entered the scene, ready to disrupt your journey with its ferocity!"

Another option is to employ a creative solution or, given your notable strength, challenge the merrow directly.\n\nThe crew looks to you, anxiety painted on their faces as they await your decision.

You feel the warmth of your own blood mix with the icy rain.
