      "content": "You blink awake to the crack of thunder and the sting of salty spray.\n\nYou’re standing on the deck of a sturdy caravel cutting through a dark, choppy sea. Sailors in oilskins hurry along ropes and rigging as the wind howls, snapping canvas overhead. The air smells of brine and wet wood; waves slam into the hull, sending sheets of cold water across the planks.\n\nBeyond the rail, lightning rips across a bruised red dawn sky, briefly silhouetting the distant, jagged outline of an island: Stormwreck Isle, your destination.\n\nA heavy *thump* shakes the deck behind you. Hauling itself up over the rail is a hulking, sea‑green creature with long claws, a mouth full of needle teeth, and ragged fins trailing from its arms. Water streams from its scaled hide as it leers at you.\n\nIn a harsh, gurgling voice it growls, \n\n“THESE WATERS BELONG TO THE SCALED QUEEN. I’M HERE TO COLLECT HER TRIBUTE.”\n\nAs your Dungeon Master, I describe what you see, hear, and face in the world—and roll for monsters and their actions. You describe what your hero does: what you say, where you move, what you try. When the outcome is uncertain, we roll a d20 and add bonuses from your character to see how it goes.\n\nRight now, this creature is blocking part of the deck and glaring at you and the crew. You can respond however you like. Some possibilities:\n- Try to **negotiate** or stall it.\n- **Attack** it before it can threaten anyone.\n- Try a **creative tactic** (use the ship, the crew, or a trick).\n- **Ask about the Scaled Queen** it mentioned.\n\nWhat do you do or say to this creature?"

Water drips from its claws as it leans closer, the ship rocking beneath its weight.\n\n“In GOLD,” it rasps, savoring the word. “Four hundred pieces for safe passage. Or I take the tribute in BLOOD instead.”\n\nSailors nearby mutter nervously; that’s an enormous sum for a simple crossing.\n\nIt watches you carefully now, gauging your reaction.\n\nYou get the sense you could try to haggle it down, scare it, or trick it with your words.\n\nWhat approach do you take?\n- Try to **talk it down** to a lower price.\n- **Threaten or intimidate** it into backing off.\n- **Deceive** it with a false promise or fake payment.\n- Change tack and either **attack** or try some **creative ploy** with the ship or crew.\n\nTell me exactly what you say or do next.\n\n[Entered: Negotiating with the Merrow]\nThe merrow looms over you on the slick deck, water streaming from its scaled form.

If I were you, I’d cut it to three hundred to avoid a pointless conflict.”\n\nThe merrow’s lip curls, and for a heartbeat you think you’ve gotten through. Lightning flashes, outlining its hulking form as waves slam into the hull.\n\nIt snorts, a wet, guttural sound. “You think I FEAR this storm, little land‑meat?” It jabs a clawed finger toward your chest. “But… you speak of avoiding conflict. Hrrr.”\n\nIt glances around at the terrified crew and the heaving sea, then back to you, considering.\n\n“Three hundred is too little,” it growls at last. “But… perhaps I don’t need ALL of your shiny metal today. I will take **three hundred fifty gold pieces**. Not a coin less. Refuse, and the Scaled Queen will drink your blood from these waters.”\n\nThe sailors look at you anxiously, some shaking their heads, others silently begging you to agree. The merrow looms, clearly still willing to talk, but its patience is not endless.\n\nYou can:\n- Try to **haggle further** (push it lower than 350 gp).\n- **Threaten or intimidate** it into backing off.\n- **Agree to pay** the 350 gp (in coin or equivalent cargo).\n- **Refuse and risk a fight**, drawing steel instead of coin.\n\nWhat do you do or say next?"
