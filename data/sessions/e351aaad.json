A few crew members rush about, preparing for the impending storm. One older sailor, his face weathered and lined, nods in your direction with a stern gaze—perhaps a silent warning.\n\nDespite the tension in the air, your casual greeting floats above the sounds of the churning sea. Nearby, the ship's captain, a grizzled half-elf known as Captain Soliath, acknowledges your presence with a brief nod. \"Brace yourself,\" he calls over the growing howl of the wind. \"There’s worse in these waters than storms.\"\n\nAs you look around, you notice the sky growing darker, the clouds swirling ominously. Thunder rumbles in the distance, promising more than just rain."

Sailors scurry around you, hurriedly securing ropes and battening down the hatches as gusts of wind whip through the sails with a ferocity befitting the island’s reputation. The ship's deck offers a panoramic view of the threatening storm gathering on the horizon; the dark waters are churning with energy as if something monstrous were rising from the deep.\n\nWithout warning, a bright flash of lightning splits the sky, momentarily blinding you. As the thunder roars directly overhead, an immense figure emerges from the sea, scaling the side of the ship with supernatural ease. It's a gruesome creature, half-fish, half-man, its slick scales shimmering in the strobe light of the storm. The merrow grins wickedly as it hauls itself onto the deck, clearly intent on causing havoc.\n\nThe ship's crew stumbles back in panic, and Captain Soliath shouts, \"To arms! To arms!\"\n\nA battle is imminent as the creature lunges forward with razor-sharp claws extended. What do you do?"

It extends a webbed hand towards you, claws gleaming menacingly. \"These waters belong to the Scaled Queen,\" it growls, a hint of malice in its voice. \"I’m here to collect her tribute.\"\n\nIt seems the creature is demanding payment of some kind to allow your ship safe passage through these troubled waters. You could try to negotiate, find a creative solution, or prepare for combat if negotiations fall through."
