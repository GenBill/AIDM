Surrounding you is the vast expanse of ocean, its surface rippling under the gentle sway of the vessel. Farther in the distance, dark, rolling clouds gather ominously, their edges flickering with distant lightning. It's clear that a storm is brewing, its promise painted vividly in hues of dark gray and black against the morning sky, now lightened only by the eerie, crimson sunrise.\n\nIn the shadows of these forming clouds, the looming silhouette of Stormwreck Isle barely breaks the horizon—a dark shape with secrets yet to unveil. The name alone suggests danger, whispering tales of shipwrecks and lost sailors.\n\nThe crew bustles about, preparing the ship for the approaching storm, their voices tense but experienced. Your own mission remains forefront: to uncover the mysteries that Stormwreck Isle holds.\n\nSuddenly, a light splash catches your ear as something breaks the surface of the water nearby. You peer over the ship's rail, feeling a chill as if watched by unseen eyes. What could be lurking just beneath the waves?\n\n[Entered: Merrow Encounter]\nAs lightning flashes across the sky, a monster hauls itself up onto the deck! 'These waters belong to the Scaled Queen. I’m here to collect her tribute.'"
