They seemed to enjoy their authority and subjugate the people they’re supposed to protect. Your background shaped your character as a righteous warrior. You learned several languages in the course of your military career (shown in “Languages” on page 1).",

Shafts of light penetrate through tall, stained glass windows casting vibrant patterns on the marble floor. At the center of this vast expanse lies a large, intricately carved wooden table, surrounded by comfortable chairs. On the table, various maps and scrolls are spread out, inviting an allure of adventure yet to be fully realized.\n\nThis is the gathering place for heroes before they set out on their quests, a room built for strategizing and fellowship. The air smells faintly of aged parchment and the lingering aroma of a feast once served.\n\nYou stand ready to embark on a great journey, the beginning of legendary tales waiting to be penned."
