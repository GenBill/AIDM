Thunder rumbles in the distance, and the sea churns with a restless energy. The crew moves about with a tense efficiency, their faces lined with a mix of anticipation and worry.\n\nYour greeting is carried away by the rising wind, unheard above the creaking of the ship's timbers and the flapping of sails struggling against the swell. Just then, a brilliant flash of lightning illuminates the world in stark relief. You watch the ocean aglow, but in that momentary light, a hulking shape clambers up from the depths, revealing the monstrous form of a merrow, its eyes gleaming with malice."
