Sailors shout and scramble, but all eyes are drawn to the thing looming over the rail.\n\nThe creature is half-hunched, thick green scales slick with seawater, gills flaring. Its long arms end in webbed claws wrapped around a rusted trident. Yellow eyes gleam in the stormlight as lightning flashes overhead.\n\nIt bares a mouthful of needle teeth and rumbles in a deep, growling voice, clearly trying to sound grand and terrifying:\n\n\"These waters belong to the Scaled Queen. I’m here to collect her tribute.\"\n\nAs your question hangs in the air, I’ll pop out of character for a second: I’m your Dungeon Master. I’ll describe the world, its creatures, and what they do. You describe what your character does or says in response. Whenever the outcome is uncertain—like trying to persuade a monster, leap across a gap, or spot a hidden clue—we’ll usually roll a d20 and add bonuses from your character sheet to see what happens.\n\nThe merrow squints at you, seeming confused by your response, then snorts.\n\n\"Adventure? Hah. Your *adventure* is deciding how you’ll pay the Scaled Queen. Gold. Gems. Cargo. Or…\" It drags a claw across the deck with a slow screech. \"Maybe you pay in blood instead.\"\n\nRain spatters across the planks as the crew edges back, giving you space—no one seems eager to step between you and the monster.\n\nYou have a few obvious ways you could handle this:\n- **Negotiate**: Try to talk it down, stall, bargain, or scare it off.\n- **Attack the merrow**: Go for weapons first and let steel (or spells) answer.\n- **Try a creative tactic**: Use the ship, the crew, spells, or trickery to outsmart or bypass it.\n- **Ask about the Scaled Queen**: Probe for information—who is this ruler it serves, and why are these waters hers?\n\nWhat do you do or say next?"

Let’s start with the price.”\n\nThe merrow’s gills flare. It was clearly expecting screams, not haggling. For a heartbeat, the only sounds are the slap of waves against the hull and the creak of timbers under strain.\n\nThen it lets out a wet, rumbling chuckle.\n\n“Ha! This one has a spine.” It leans its bulk over the rail, trident casually scraping long grooves into the deck. “The Scaled Queen claims these waters. Her tribute is simple: **four hundred gold** in coin or goods. Pay, and you pass. Refuse…” Its lip curls, revealing rows of needle teeth. “And we paint your deck red instead.”\n\nSeveral sailors glance nervously between you and the creature, clearly looking to you to take the lead.\n\nYou get the sense the merrow expects an answer now.\n\nYou can:\n- **Negotiate**: Try to talk it down from 400 gp, stall for time, or intimidate it.\n- **Attack the merrow**: Draw steel or cast a spell and start the fight.\n- **Try a creative tactic**: Use the ship, the crew, trickery, or magic to outsmart or bypass it.\n- **Ask about the Scaled Queen**: Prod it for more information about its so-called queen.\n\nWhat do you do next?"

How about we reduce it to 300? That’s better for both of us.”\n\nThe deckhands nearby go very still. A few exchange quick, hopeful glances.\n\nThe merrow’s trident scrapes a harsh line across the planks as it leans in, yellow eyes narrowing. For a long, tense moment you can hear only the hiss of rain and the creak of the mast.\n\nThen it snorts a wet, derisive laugh.\n\n“Three hundred?” It bares its teeth in a grin. “You think I’m some gullible dolphin to be fed scraps? No. The Scaled Queen set the tribute at four hundred. You’ll pay it… or you’ll sink here and become a story told by drunken sailors.”\n\nIts gills flare as it straightens up to its full height, clearly annoyed that you tried to haggle. It slams the butt of its trident against the deck, hard enough to make several sailors flinch.\n\n“But… I’ll give you one more chance,” it growls. “Pay the full price. Now. Or we stop talking.”\n\nThe mood on deck is getting ugly. The merrow’s patience is thinning, and you can feel the crew tensing, some hands drifting toward weapons.\n\nAt this point, you sense you won’t get it to budge with simple words. You can:\n- Try a **bolder negotiation tactic** (sweeten the deal with something specific, lie, or openly intimidate it).\n- **Attack the merrow**, taking advantage of how close it’s come to the rail.\n- Try a **creative ploy** using the ship, the crew, or any tricks you can think of.\n- **Pay the full tribute** if you actually want to avoid bloodshed at a cost.\n\nWhat do you do next?\n\n[Entered: Negotiating with the Merrow]\nThe merrow looms over you on the slick deck, water streaming from its scaled form.
