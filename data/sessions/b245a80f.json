Ahead lies Stormwreck Isle, your mysterious destination, though you can feel a sense of unease grow as the sky darkens with thick clouds threatening to unleash their fury. The air carries the sharp taste of salt, and every distant rumble of thunder seems to vibrate through the deck. You're in the middle of the Sea of Swords, on a course for adventure, and perhaps danger."
